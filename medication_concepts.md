#### Medication Treatment Plan (MTP)



Medication Treatment line that hasn’t been executed yet. 
A medication treatment line MAY have status “planned” (or no “actionable” status) but it’s still a line.

Subtype of Order, that hasn’t been executed yet and is not yet actionable.

For this reason, we will no longer use “Medication Treatment Plan” expression and concept in our specifications.
