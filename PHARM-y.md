This is a normal case, where the medication line is the trigger for prescriptions

1. Psychiatrist decides that patient should initiate treatment for depression, indicating bupropion. They create a treatment line for that patient. No prescription is necessarily authorized yet.
   * At this moment, querying a patient’s current medications should return this line, with status “????”
2. After checking contraindications, psychiatrist decides to the treat patient with fluoxetine instead. The prescription is finally issued for 1 box of 30 tablets
   * At this moment, querying a patient’s current medications should return this line, with status “????”
3. When medication is dispensed, the medicationline is not updated but the medication may be added the link
